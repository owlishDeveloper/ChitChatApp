/**
 * This class represents messages that client and server exchange.
 *
 * There are 5 possible kinds of messages
 * (all represented by this type because I don't want 4 tiny classes).
 *
 * The class has constructors for only 3 of those,
 * because the first two kinds are always generated by clients.
 * We need to be able to serialize and deserialize those messages, however,
 * therefore they are included in this combined type.
 *
 * ---- Messages generated by clients: ----
 *
 * // broadcasted
 * type: "message",
 * text: "some text typed in by the user",
 * id: clientID,
 * date: 2349875459,
 * username: "someUsername" // added by the server
 *
 * // broadcasted
 * type: "username"
 * username: "someUsername",
 * id: clientID,
 * date: 2349875459
 *
 *  ---- Messages generated by server: ----
 *
 * type: "rejectusername",
 * username: "usernameGeneratedByServerAndEnsuredUnique"
 * id: clientID
 *
 * type: "id",
 * id: clientID
 *
 * // broadcasted
 * type: "userlist",
